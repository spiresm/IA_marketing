  "texte": "A realistic scene where the Black character stands in the center, sharp and detailed, with cinematic lighting. Around him, waves of translucent water and liquid paint rise and swirl, as if he is underwater. Bubbles and light rays pass through the liquid, creating a dreamy, immersive atmosphere. Each gesture makes the water move, bending and flowing with his motion. Muted pastel tones of blue, teal, and soft yellow, with natural textures, not oversaturated.",
