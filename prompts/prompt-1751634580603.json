  "texte": "A moody, cinematic photo of a cozy living room at night. A flat-screen TV is perfectly centered in the frame, viewed straight-on from the front. It sits on a mid-century wooden cabinet. The TV is turned off, reflecting the soft glow of the room. The wall behind it is clean, smooth, and painted in a warm matte color, with maybe one or two framed photos. Warm, ambient lighting comes from a floor lamp and loosely hanging fairy lights. A blanket is thrown casually on a nearby couch, a book lies open on the cabinet, and a mug sits beside it. A cat is curled up on a rug in front. The room feels real and lived-in — not staged. There’s light clutter, soft shadows, and a sense of quiet. Shot with shallow depth of field and soft cinematic lens flare.",
