  "texte": "A realistic scene inside a circus tent. The character stands in the middle of the ring on sawdust, under red and white striped fabric with spotlights shining down. Circus details like ropes, banners, and props in the background, kept minimal. The character wears a clown-inspired costume with colorful fabrics, stripes, polka dots, and a bow tie. Sharp, detailed, cinematic lighting, with muted colors, pastel tones, and balanced contrast (not oversaturated).",
