  "texte": "A high-action, ultra-photorealistic image of a super cute and extremely happy sheep mid-leap, full of energy, captured with dramatic motion blur and perfect cinematic timing. The sheep wears a pink-striped party hat and holds a colorful party horn in its mouth. Its fluffy wool bounces in motion, with expressive, joyful eyes. Positioned in the lower center of the frame, all four legs are off the ground mid-jump. The setting is a lush green meadow surrounded by majestic mountains, under a golden hour sky glowing with warm, dynamic light. In the far background, a man in traditional Middle Eastern or Kurdish attire runs playfully after the sheep, slightly blurred to enhance depth and action. A rustic wooden fence cuts across the left side of the image, while birds soar across the upper sky. Dust particles, motion lines, and lens flares add a sense of speed and vitality. Shot with a shallow depth of field, soft shadows, and natural golden light. Perfectly balanced composition, editorial-style, high-speed camera simulation, cinematic beauty, joyful mood",
