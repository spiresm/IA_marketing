  "texte": "The character must be in a fantasy and imaginary universe, with a soft cinematic style. The color palette must revolve around #DE0067, #0DFCFE and #FFCC00, in pastel or muted tones. The image should be sharp and detailed, with fine textures, crisp edges and a high-definition look. Lighting should be realistic and balanced, with natural shadows and subtle highlights.",
