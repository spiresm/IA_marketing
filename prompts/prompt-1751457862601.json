  "texte": "A solitary tree standing in the middle of a lush green field in the winter countryside of Brabant, Belgium. Rolling hills and patchwork farmlands stretch into the background under a bright blue sky with scattered fluffy clouds. The tree casts a soft shadow on the sunlit grass, and a warm summer breeze gently moves the tall grass. Peaceful and vibrant rural atmosphere, wide-angle shot, realistic and cinematic style.",
