  "texte": "A photorealistic wide shot of a small, single-seat spacecraft drifting quietly in low orbit around a large, realistic planet. The spacecraft is compact and utilitarian — no wings — built for orbital travel, with a minimal, functional design: exposed modules, thrusters, and sensor arrays. Its surface is matte gray with slight wear and subtle reflections. The planet beneath is massive, based on real NASA imagery — with rocky or gaseous textures in natural tones. The environment is deep space: no nebulae, only blackness with distant stars. Sharp, directional sunlight creates long shadows and realistic glints on the hull. The scene feels vast, silent, and grounded in plausible aerospace engineering. Cinematic framing, ultra-realistic, 4K.",
