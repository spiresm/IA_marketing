Uneven ground scattered with fallen leaves, moss-covered tree trunks, and branches tangled in natural disorder. Trees are irregularly spaced, some leaning slightly, with a mix of bare branches and colorful foliage in shades of muted orange, yellow, and brown. Soft, grey overcast light filters through the canopy. The forest floor is damp and textured, with patches of mud, rocks, and undergrowth. No symmetry, no perfection â€” just a raw, quiet forest captured like a real photograph.",
