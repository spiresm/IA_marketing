  "texte": "a majestic Siberian tiger sleeps peacefully on a bed of moss-covered rocks, surrounded by ancient bamboo groves. The tiger's orange fur is dotted with black stripes, its massive paws curled gently under its chin, and a soft stream of breath fogs the cool morning air. A single white lily rests between its front paws, while sunlight filters through the bamboo leaves, casting dappled shadows across its back. In the background, a misty mountain range rises, and a small waterfall trickles into a pool lined with smooth stones. A faded red ribbon, tied to a nearby bamboo stalk, flutters gently in the breeze. The tiger's tail twitches occasionally, as if chasing a dream, and its whiskers stand out against the peaceful setting. 3D rendered with realistic fur texture and soft lighting",
